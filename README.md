# analysis-results-cluster-02-crate
A repository to contain the results of the MetaGOflow analyses runs (cluster 2)

This respository contains **TEMPORARY** EMO BON MetaGoFlow analyses RO-Crates from Batch 3 (internal designation).
The EMBL ENA Accession numbers for the raw sequence data are missing from the metadata JSON file and the Turtle-formatted triple files (.ttl) and will be added at a later date. The ro-crates do however contain the "cleaned and trimmed" forward and reverse reads created prior to QC.
